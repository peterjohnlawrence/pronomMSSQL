  rdfs:comment "Audio encoded in a digital form which can be decoded and output via a computer. They are digital representations of audio waveforms, and are files that are intended to be heard rather than read. An audio file may be a raw bitstream, but is often presented as part of a multimedia format."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "Indicates a format that represents non database management system data, e.g. NetCDF (Network common data form), SAS XPORT, FITS, and CSV. A dataset can be primarily text oriented which can be opened in a text editor but might also be rendered in an application. A dataset may also be binary i.e. a dataset that isn't a database or traditional spreadsheet data, NetCDF being an example of this."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "A raster image is a data structure that allows the representation of an image from a series of bits of information. It is intended that the bits are translated into pixels for representation on a display medium. Each pixel is assigned a specific value which determines its colour, and these pixels create an overall finished image."@en ;
